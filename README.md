# Learn Spanish by coding

Currently I am working on this project for fun.

My main aim is to code from scratch some rules, identify patterns, while I am trying to learn something in Spanish.
Mostly the code is about conjugating verbs in order to create some of the tenses in Spanish.

The main variation of Spanish that I am working on is **Castellano**.

Any native speaker (or not) who would like to contribute to this project, either by adding something new or correcting my mistakes, is more than welcome to do so.

In case you want to contact me, you could find my contact details on my [website](https://paschalisag.github.io/).
